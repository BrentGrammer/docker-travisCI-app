# React app deployed to AWS using Docker and TravisCI

The purpose of this app is to learn and work with Docker and TravisCI for deploying apps to AWS using containerization and a continuous integration workflow.

See the /Notes folder for a rundown of the different processes and some self made documentation I've created which you may find helpful if you're learning about containerization and CI workflows as well.
